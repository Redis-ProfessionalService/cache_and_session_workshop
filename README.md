# Cache and Session Storage Workshop
## Using Redis as a cache and session store 
This workshop also covers using the Redis search and query engine to find sessions that fit the criteria you set.  
Inside the `workshop` folder is another `README.md` file that gives the terminal command for loading the prerequisites.
After running that, simply open the Jupyter notebook, `Presentation.ipynb` and follow allong.
